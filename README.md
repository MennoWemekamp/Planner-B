[Plan B: Terraform](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894430/Plan_B_Terraform/)

This will be a calculator for the game Plan B: Terraform.

It is an app that a user can select one final product, and how many of said product they want per year, it will then display the entire production chain from raw resource to requested amount of final product with every step in between.

## Features

- Calculator

## Tech stack

1. Interface:

   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript

1. Calculations:

   - JavaScript

1. Data Storage:

   - TBD // probably JSON or JScript Obj

1. Webserver:

1. Development:

   - Visual Studio Code

   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Steps to be done

1.  Aggregate (collect) all the data that is needed to make the calculations.
2.  Build an interface that allows users to interact.
    Interface:
    2a. Either be a an input box of a number and a dropdown list with a product. Or a list of all possible products with an input box for number and a checkbox to indicate that this product will be included in the calculation.
    2b. Resulting production chain will be a list of buildings and the amount that building needed, and the recipe/resource for each of those buildings.
3.  Make the calculations.

## Summary of the project

- To create a usable calculator to calculation production chain in the game "Plan B".
- To learn the basics of coming up with and executing a project.
- Practicing with the languages and tech used to build the project.
